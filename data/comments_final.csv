Thousands of emotions run through his brain as he slowly opens the case. Inside is a single note that says ""fuck you"". Underneath is a plastic toy ring with a mold of Varejao as he is falling to the floor like his been shot. After a few monents Varejao grimaces and clutches his chest. He collapses to the floor and stops moving. The paramedics are called. When they arrive they start taking his vitals.

6211,Nice curry still spamming square ,1466382639
6212,can't leave curry wide open on the corner like that!,1466382639
6213,Curry is a big liability on defense,1466382639
6214,That was like 5 steps,1466382641
6215,I LOVE ME SOME LOVE!,1466382641
6216,Klove at least making plays on the glass,1466382641
6217,"Lebron out, this is a huge stretch",1466382641
6218,Really impressed the cavs are hanging in this game ,1466382641
6219,Richard Jefferson getting crossed up by Draymond lol,1466382641

6225,LeBron on the bench is danger time,1466382647
6226,Keep hustlin Kev,1466382647
6227,"Damn bad foul by Curry. Please don't keep reaching today. Even if you get all ball, the refs might call it a foul. Not worth it.",1466382648
6228,"please Dizzy Kev, make your free throws",1466382649
6229,Damn that was almost a foulless quarter!,1466382650

6237,Lebron has 6 rebounds at the end of the 1st quarter...,1466382663

10948,Varejao did.,1466383036

13115,Against Steph.,1466383011
13116,Denying curry the ability to run the court and get a good shot off. ,1466383022
13117,steph curry is pretty good w/ 5 sec left on an inbound,1466383022
13118,"No stopping Curry from catching, running past half court and hitting the buzzer beater that he's done countless times.",1466383024
13119,"Well the idea was that they denied Curry from taking the half court. So they got a 3/4 shot from speights, that was the goal.",1466383044
13120,he needs to stay on the bench,1466383043
13121,Surprised they didn't split it up into minute-by-minute threads,1466383126

13217,Woot woot salt wagon. ,1466384324
13218,Yeah Green is going to finish the game shooting 80% no problem ,1466384701

13254,Except he drained a 3?,1466382450
13255,he made his first shot,1466382450
13256,He hit his first 3... so he's missed 3 in a row yo. ,1466382451
13257,well he knocked down a 3 earlier ,1466382454
13258,"He made a 3 to start the game, so he's only at 3 or 4 consecutive misses.",1466382457
13259,"He hit a 3 to start the game. IMO perfect for the cavs, just enough confidence to keep shooting, but he also shoots a lot now",1466382458
13260,he hit a 3 in the beginning of the game,1466382458

13262,He hit a three? Are you watching? Haha,1466382469
13263,he made a three to start off the game,1466382481

13267,are you being sarcastic? they sell those jerseys with sleeves,1466383057
13268,i'd say that's a safe bet.,1466383062
13269,Honestly they've had that already. They had a stretch of being 5-6 from 3 but still didn't pull away. Cleveland is killing them on the boards. ,1466383132
13270,Clear foul by Thompson. Loves to shove in the back. ,1466383456
13271,According to JVG Lebron is so great it won't matter though.,1466383612

13273,R/nba explodes,1466383677
13274,It's 7 vs. 7 but ok.,1466384168
13275,Curry got called for a reach like the play before and Shump just had a 4 point play ,1466384171
13276,Huh?,1466384746
13277,lebrao is gonna come out looking to score in 2nd half. ,1466384768
13278,"very surprising how close Cavs have managed to keep this, despite playing dogshit defense and taking 15 secs to get into their offense or take a quick contested shot ",1466384793

13293, #deleteyouraccount,1466383595
13294,Homecourt advantage ,1466384212
13295,Serious answer: Yes,1466383050
13296,I think he was telling the refs he had his arm held by V.,1466383069
13297,The ref was just probably telling him to chill after he bumped Verajao. Nothing serious ,1466383070
13298,As a drunk man I have no idea what you just said,1466383092
13299,"Hey man, how are the wife and kids?",1466383133
13300,Most players do that,1466383179
13301,"Ref came up to him to talk that time, probably gave him a warning.",1466382897
13302,Because that's what you do in sports. Get along well with the refs. Let them know what you think is happening to you and they can keep an eye out for it if it is.,1466382979
13303,You control the refs you control the game. Same thing kobe and jordan always did,1466382924
13304,Fined ,1466384991

13309,Cant argue with that,1466383231
13310,Nah that was a clear foul ,1466384144
13311,Meanwhile they hold the whistle when Livingston tries to intentionally foul LeBron on the breakaway.. ,1466384155
13312,This has been the best officiated game by far. Not sure what you're seeing.,1466384762
13313,You need to watch it again ,1466385050
13315,"That, and have two of the best shooters in the league as well as top tier defence ",1466384258

13322,"lol you try arresting him for that and you'll get demoted and laughed at bud, stop being a hater. BTW, I'm rooting for the Cavs, but what you said is straight up ridiculous.",1466381472
13323,lmfao. turn the game off and start jerking it to drose videos from 5 years ago.,1466382307
13324,"Dude, I don't like Curry, I admit, but I remember him winning the skills challenge as a pre-ruined-ankles baby. He has handles, man.",1466382426
13325,Those turnovers hurt. ,1466383027
13326,needs to get hot next quarter. 6 pts a quarter ain't enough,1466383054
13327,I would be seriously interested to see who on the Dubs even make a case for fmvp if they win. Klay? Green? I think Bron deserves it hands down,1466383064
13328,Please don't jinx it. ,1466383068
13329,Its one fuckin quarter ,1466383095
13330,I still think it can go 50/50. Eventually one team is gunna make that run and put up 10 in a row. I can see either team doing it..,1466383217
13331,You gotta have a stupid fuckin haircut to get the call.,1466384026

13345,That curry had his right hand wrapped around his back. ,1466384084
13346,Why the refs can't spot a flop.,1466384084
13347,That you guys clearly flopped running into each other? lol.,1466384099
13348,dude is straight up balling out there,1466384154
13349,"At home he's fine, away he struggles in these moments ",1466384154
13350,Unlike Barnes who apparently shrinks down a minion,1466384162
13351,"i mean, he himself said he was timid the last game.",1466384326
13352,Like the refs have any idea what constitutes a foul these days lmao. ,1466383089
13353,Because you've shot what 11 3pters? Only 9 shots not 3s and some of those were jumpers. So not sure what you are complaining about?,1466383120
13354,Horse fucking shit. The guy takes more uncalled contact than anyone in the league. What shit are you smoking?,1466384118
13355,He's been getting no calls all night.,1466384164
13356,What game are you watching? He's gotten one foul call on him.,1466384172
13359,Even if it was Lebron putting Steph on skates and hitting an MJ-esque fade putting Steph in a spiraling depression eventually into retirement. ,1466381415
13360,Even if its a Moe Williams 3/4th court heave?,1466381429
13361,Really? We're in the lead,1466381644
13362,lol what 2 minutes in,1466381661
13363,"And as I say that, he gets blocked by TT, lol :D",1466381847

13365,Dropped an s? But seriously,1466382206
13366,Going for the quad double,1466382220
13367,and 1 for curry now.,1466382231
13368,he's gotta take open shots,1466382369
13369,"the 1964 browns, i believe?",1466383186
13370,"yes, it's right next to the button that says ""lunch"" ",1466382602
13371,Ya we've all seen the 30 for 30.,1466382561
13372,"i agree...after being bullied and belittled in game 6, he should be allllll business tonight. ",1466382938
13373,It's a rule but they kinda stopped enforcing it.  They give warnings & stop after that.,1466382828
13374,Would you say they're...  Pretty good?,1466382814
13375,Harrison Barnes.,1466383030
13376,they are destroying GS on the boards,1466383047
13377,the 3's will dry up as they begin to depend on them more. generally their second half has been terrible beyond the arc.,1466383100
13378,Those shots have to keep going in. ,1466383101
13379,They're winning with 0 3's ,1466383252
13380,You don't. Just shitpost and move on. If you aren't averaging 2 posts/min you're doing it wrong. ,1466383225
13381,you don't,1466383183
13382,agreed ,1466383272
13383,I like how you think we understand it,1466383345
13384,I would also like to know,1466383346
13385,Nah they dont need it,1466383389
13386,Jordan is still the GOAT no matter what happens today,1466383427
13387,"MJ has that pinned down, bruh. Lebron is phenomenal, but he's always gotten fucked by his teams. MJ had the skill, talent and fucking four other guys backing him up. ",1466383462
13388,"Well, not really.",1466383379
13389,Nice irrelevant stat,1466383532
13390,Only because he's still hanging onto Adams',1466383649
13391,Jr and Kyrie probably gonna play the entire 2nd half,1466383654
13392,I am the Curry now,1466383596
13393,except for when Klay chucks those long ass 3s,1466383715
13394,Two players are better than one. Wow.,1466383636
13395,"He currently has no buckets. Huehuehue.... oh well, I'm out.",1466383807
13396,In this fast of a game thread no one will notice,1466383900
13397,Autism,1466384068
13398,They're not gonna make as many calls in a game seven,1466384005
13399,They usually let them play more physically in the playoffs. Plus players are probably embellishing contact more cause the stakes are higher ,1466384099
13400,Wouldn't be surprised if he stretched them out,1466384121
13401,nah he's just been skipping shoulder day.,1466384130

I'm a bit confused as to what you meant in the middle, but I think your asking about why dont we see many cavs fans in the arena. Well that's probably because first of all any ticket for a game 7 costs tons of money and since America is so large, Cleveland and Oakland(Where the warriors play) is probably about a 4 hour plane ride. So if you add the cost of the plane ticket, getting somewhere to stay in Oakland, and the price of the game ticket itself, its a whole lot money. Also because of that, fans don't really have a reason to go to oakland  if they weren't going to the game because there'd be nothing to do. The winning team usually has a victory parade in their city a few days after they win where they will be in floats and cars going down the main streets of their own city celebrating as as fans can watch.

I counted...maybe 2 soft calls but nothing egregious.Final View of 1st Half:* It's closer than it looks. The Cavs were abysmal from 3 in the first half. You have to assume they'll progress to the mean. Warriors are shooting better than average, but not by so much that you expect a second half drop unless the Cavs adjust. * If the Warriors can stay patient, play better defense in the paint, and Curry or Klay stop playing like ass, then they'll probably win* Conversely, if the Cavs wake up from their 3-pt slumber (or just abandon it), cool off the Warriors from distance, and Lebron and/or Kyrie get back to their Game 5 & 6 form, the Cavs should be able to come back.",1466385651

21745,Lebron won't be able to take his game over until he gets his jumper sorted out. Thats the difference between a good LJ game and a God mode game,1466385493
21746,Cavs are shooting 38% from 3 and 1-14 from 3 and yet are only down 7. Make a few shots and guard Draymond a bit better and they can win. But seriously who on the bench can provide quality minutes? Honestly the starters and RJ might have to play the full 24,1466385493
21747,pretty trash offensive half played by cleveland. im starting to feel deflated. gonna take my routine halftime power shower now and hope the score is more hope-inspiring when i get back. hate to see it continue like this. when all else fails give the ball to lebron and let him run wild for 24 mins. at least they gambled on the best player in the nba,1466385493

Nobody jump to contest Livingstone's mid range jumper, despite knowing that this man hits quite a number of those. They leave Green way too open way too often on the perimeter. Come on.. Lebron is also very sloppy on his passes, I hope he's not trying to get that 19 ast for a triple double finals average.. he hasn't attacked the basket like he did the last 2 games.Hope Lue talks some sense into those guys.",1466385498

31553,Okay so Draymond is not going to have another half like that. Kyrie and Klay haven't done much and are due for theirs. Cleveland can't buy a three and is only down 7. Lebron has been having a hard time balancing being agressive and getting his teammates involved like he seems to be doing that at the wrong times. Cleveland has also had some strange substitution patterns. I have a gut feeling the shooting will balance out a bit more with these two teams and we're looking at a finish right down to the wire with a role player making a huge clutch play. ,1466385404

Is that what you're saying? Because if you're saying that I can assure you that you're wrong. Why would you make these posts while the game is still being played? Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded posts like this. You know why? Because you're going to be embarrassed when the Cavs win. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a post on this subreddit again and I'm fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you're the only guy making all these anti-Cavs posts because you're a shill who doesn't like them because they're good.

33618,Maybe next season if the coach has another yr under his belt... but then again LeBron and Kyrie like to play hero ball. ,1466388641

33676,Now if only someone on their team could shoot 3s.,1466389118
33677,7/18 with 7 minutes left in the season isn't acceptable from him. He needs to do more. ,1466389094
33678,"For real. Only Lebron could drop a triple double and ""not show up""",1466389098
33679,Well he's not showing up like he should,1466389106

33734,Kyrie's been amazing.  Unfortunately he will probably be overshadowed by LeBron when people look back at this series (he is probably overshadowed by LeBron right now).Draymond's stepped up in game 7 and proved he is a big game player.

33745,"If nothing else, Barnes ain't getting max",1466390610
33746,"i don't think it was edited, i think the stream failed.  He was talking about thanking god and stuff.  Lebron is way to media savvy to swear to the press like that.",1466390703
33747,Who would want to?,1466390661
33748,please deliver with the crying lebron meme,1466390677
33749,Real question. Does Blast get a ring?,1466390798

33757,as a Caviler,1466391173
33758,"As a Celtics fan, it definitely kills me seeing him in that way.",1466391242

33763,"I'm praying, just this one time. Please.",1466388635
33764,you didn't before man? i'm pulling for gsw but LeBron is one of the best ,1466390253
33765,Curry going to come out with a vengeance in the second half.Maybe he needs to knock a ref over like Barbosa did,1466385268

33770,I unfortunately agree. LeBron is probably gonna turn it up.,1466385564
33771,LeBron and Kyrie yet to have offensive spurts. They'll adjust. I believe. I think it's gonna get really interesting in the 2nd half.,1466385590
33772,because he has more points than your team wins,1466385892
33773,Don't have to be ripped to be strong.,1466385906
33774,Instead of bad offense think of good defense,1466385928
33775,Game 7s are rarely pretty,1466385943
33776,Because Draymond FG:  8/10 (80%) | 5/5 3PM (100%),1466385982
33777,The crazy part is that the 3pt% is not that much higher than the season average of 42%,1466386058

35066,I miss Chuck and co.,1466385747

35073,Close is more entertaining,1466385547

35076,I've been telling people that for years.,1466385501
35077,"Looking long term, his jumper is going to decide what sort of career second half he has. MJ and Kobe adjusted their games to manage their declining athleticism. We'll see if LeBron can.",1466385636
35078,So that's why Kerr continues to play him... ,1466385656

35080,Yes. And they will.,1466385624

35089,Diamond is like 5-5 from the field for 21 points. LeBron has 12-8-5 and is playing solid. The Cavs are like 1-14 from 3 while the Warriors are 10-20 and thats why they have such a big lead,1466385700

35114,He got like 2 minutes in the 2nd.,1466386017
35115,"I just assume Green can't keep scoring with the same efficiency. That said, I would have said the same for Kyrie. And tbh, if Green keeps this up, it should be a GSW game.However, Cavs are still in this despite the piss poor shooting, they can easily get something better going. I can see LeBron giving it more in the second half, he avoided driving a bit. Also agreed with your analysis. Whichever star makes a run for his team, that seem will win this. So far, all 4 has been relatively quiet.",1466386104

37186,"I'm pretty sure I've seen threads hit 30,000 comments before",1466386606
37187,Wow okay i didn't know that. I'm not used to those distances as a European. Wouldn't it be fair to play game 7 at neutral ground?,1466386693
37188,Looked like Jamie Fox,1466386520
37189,yeah you have to think lbj gets it if cavs win for sure...but if JR goes nuts and carries them in this game he could get it...they always overreact to whoever did best in last game,1466386553
37190,The coin flip resulted in... **Heads**.^^I am a bot! Did I mess something up? [Report an issue here!](https://github.com/elebumm/FlipACoinForMe),1466386598
37191,Interesting. Yeah it seems like second half performance is what usually determines it. There's no question without Draymond they wouldn't still  be in this game though.,1466386759
37192,Eh he's had an impact in every game he's been in though. Especially defensively.,1466386807
37193,Out of? ,1466386654
37194,That's what I'm thinking. He's a big reason why they went up 3-1. He was huge. Most consistent player on GSW. Problem is the last game in the series is usually the decider. Especially second half performance.,1466387902
37195,I feel like Klay has been the most consistent.,1466387131
37196,His last two games have been good and he was driving those games.  Why switch it up,1466386974
37197,It was... He do not want to get into fouls problems. A last minute tied game and you want Curry in the court ,1466387473
37198,I actually have.,1466387535
37199,Got one. thanks though,1466387938

37225,But I've seen it where they count shots when the foul was off the ball? Just seems odd. ,1466388947
37226,True love is playing better this game but damn what a cold series for both of them,1466389036
37227,I was talking about the song in the truck ad.,1466389192

And then when he laid on the floor like that they kept going on and on about how it didn't even hurt etc etc. I'm just glad Cleveland won so they would shutup :P,1466391286
